        Now you will play some rounds of the game. You will be randomly
        assigned to Player A or Player B. You will play both sequentially and
        simultaneously.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Sequential Play:</strong> When you play sequentially Player A
        will decide then Player B sees Player Aâ€™s decision and makes their decision
        on how much to return. Then both participants learn of their payoffs.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Simultaneous Play:</strong> When you play simultaneously
        Player A will decide. While Player A is deciding Player B will
        simultaneously decide what percentage to return to Player A. Then both
        participants learn of their payoffs.</p>
    <p>
        A random round will be selected to be your payment round. At the end of the experiment you'll get your payoff amount from that round.
        You can only send whole dollars back and forth,
        there is no splitting of dollars except Player B in the Simultaneous game.</p>
    <p>
        <strong class="text-info">Notes on pairings:</strong> All pairings are anonymous and you will
        play with many different people. You are re-matched with a new person
        each round.
